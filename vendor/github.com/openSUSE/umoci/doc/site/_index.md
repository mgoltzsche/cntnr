## umoci ##

Made with &#10084; by [openSUSE][openSUSE].

umoci is a free software tool for manipulating and interacting with container
images in the standardised [Open Container Initiative's][oci] image format. It
provides one of the most flexible image management toolsets, requiring neither
a daemon nor any particular filesystem setup. It is already used in a variety
of different projects and by several companies.

umoci is currently in desperate need of a logo design. If you're interested in
creating a logo for us (and releasing it under a <a
href="https://creativecommons.org/">free artwork license</a>) then don't
hesitate to reach out!

### Features ###

umoci's feature set is intentionally restricted, as it has well-defined goals.

* Extraction of images produces a standardised [OCI runtime
  bundle][oci-runtime], which is immediately usable by [runc][runc] or [any
  other OCI-compliant runtime][oci-runtimes]. However, these bundles are also
  usable without the need for containers (which means that builders can mutate
  the root filesystem in whatever fashion they choose).
* Generates delta layers without requiring filesystem-specific features.
  Rather, it makes use of existing [mtree][mtree(8)] manifest tooling to
  compute the deltas of paths in the root filesystem.
* Supports [rootless containers][rootless] natively, both by allowing for
  extraction of layers that would normally require privileges and by generating
  runtime configurations that `runc` can use as an unprivileged user.
* Internal libraries are entirely built around a generic content addressable
  store interface, allowing for code reuse by other projects and the
  possibility for new backends.

### Install ###

Pre-built binaries can be downloaded from [umoci's releases page][releases]. As
umoci's builds are reproducible, a cryptographic checksum file is included in
the release assets. All of the assets are also signed with a [release
key][umoci-keyring].

umoci is also available from several distribution's repositories:

* [openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/umoci)
* [Gentoo](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-emulation/umoci)
* [Arch Linux (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/umoci/)

To build umoci from the [source code][source], a simple `make && make install`
should work on most machines. The [changelog][changelog] is also available.
